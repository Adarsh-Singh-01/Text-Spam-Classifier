Live Demo - https://text-spam-classifier-0997.streamlit.app/

A simple machine learning model that automatically classifies text messages (SMS or email) as “spam” or “not spam.” 
A small app or script that takes a user’s text message as input and predicts whether it’s spam.

1.	 Data:
•	Used public datasets like the “SMS Spam Collection Dataset.”
2.	Text Preprocessing:
•	Clean the text: lowercase, remove punctuation, strip stopwords.
•	Convert text to numerical features using tools like CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer in scikit-learn.
3.	Training the Model:
•	Use a simple algorithm (Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) from scikit-learn.
•	Split the data for training and testing.
•	Evaluate using accuracy or F1-score.
4.	Deploying a Simple Web App:
•	Using Streamlit or Gradio to build a basic web interface where users paste a message and get a “Spam/Not Spam” label.
•	Hosting it on Streamlit Cloud.
5.	Containerize
•	Package my app in a Docker container for a nice touch.
